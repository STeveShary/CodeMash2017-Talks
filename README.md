### How to write Java web apps like a JS hipster
> It’s easy to find a web-developer position at an enterprise company and spend multiple years writing code in a language that was bleeding edge 10 years ago. Passionate developers go home and continually spend time learning new languages and writing in new styles that allow them to stay up-to-date. Not everyone is up for that lifestyle and the daily grind can be miserable when you’re limited on technology choices. This session focuses on the changes that have been made in the past couple of years to allow Java to go through a “renewal” so that developers now have the ability to write code that is so similar to modern Javascript server applications. It will demonstrate how Java8, Spring Boot, AsyncIO allow developers to write code in a modern way that is concise, fast, scalable and just as “cool” as the startup in the loft downtown.


### Real-time Server Telemetry: The downfall of logging and rise of data pipelines
> Logging in modern applications is a feast or famine. Every scrap of information is needed when triaging production issues, but who can find relevant information among all the DEBUG and PERFORMANCE lines? Logging to files and STDOUT has become incompatible with cloud-native applications and distributed systems (and most other things). Modern telemetry and APM solutions need to tackle the issue of finding needles in haystacks as well as view the system from 50,000 feet with real-time data. Hear the story of our experiences at Kroger creating an open-source-based system including Elastic Search that handles over 900GBs of data each day. See how we visualize our current production status and discover problematic applications, servers and systems
